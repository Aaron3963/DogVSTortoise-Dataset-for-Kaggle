# DogVSTortoise Dataset for Kaggle 

This is the custom dataset for Kaggle 

I have collected and labeled 20,000 images with half of dog and half of tortoise 

This dataset is free for everyone 

The dataset is too large to upload to github, so I put it on BaiDuNetDisk 

Screenshot when training the model:
