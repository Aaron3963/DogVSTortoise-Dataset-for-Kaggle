# DogVSTortoise Dataset for Kaggle 

This is the custom dataset for Kaggle.<br>
I have collected and labeled 20,000 images with half of dog and half of tortoise.<br>
This dataset is free for everyone.<br>
The dataset is too large to upload to github, so I put it on BaiDuNetDisk.

## Training CNN Model
The modelBuild.py file is used for model training<br>
